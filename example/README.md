# Ninazu Usage example

This folder contains source code for a hypothetical application that interacts with a WebSocket server.

All use of the Ninazu library can be found in the `events`, `models`, and `validators` folder.

Feel free to make changes to the code, and see how the TypeScript compiler and language server behaves differently.
